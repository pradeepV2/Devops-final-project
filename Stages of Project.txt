One Master Node and Two Worker Nodes
-> Create new Security Groups
-> Earlier Minikube for creating a Cluster
-> Now, we will use KubeADM for creating a cluster
-> instance type should be t2.medium
-> Created a Kubernetes Cluster using KubeADM 


3. Create additionally 3 more Ec2 instances for the below
-> SonarQube
-> Nexus
-> Jenkins
