1. What is the Project flow?
Project flow will decide the tools that we need to USE

###############################################################################
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: -
There are two types of Projects
Scenario-1. Deploying an APP that is created from scratch
There is no infrastructure or Project flow in place and we need to decide the flow from scratch

MAINTAINANCE/SUPPORT/Enhancement PROJECT: -
Scenario-2. Deploying an APP which is already running in PRODUCTION
Users are already using the APP, but DEVELOPER will add new features to the existing APP 
Make sure that there is no DOWNTIME at the deployment
